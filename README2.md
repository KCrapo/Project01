## Project Description:
The goal of this project was to create an application that allows users to sign in, select their favorite NBA teams, and view upcoming matches with simple betting odds for those teams. The final version of the project has evolved into the following functionality:

1. Users are directed to a landing page where they can either log in or create an account.
2. After logging in, users can select from a list of NBA teams to add as their favorite teams (limited to a maximum of 4).
3. Users can navigate to an "Upcoming Games" page to view upcoming matches for their selected teams for the next two weeks.
4. Betting odds are displayed for each matchup based on whether the selected teams are playing home or away (Note: these odds are not meant for actual betting).

## Communication Management:

- **Communication Tools:** We primarily communicated via Slack. While some Zoom meetings were held, syncing up with everyone at the same time was often difficult. In retrospect, we could have improved our communication for a smoother workflow.

## Initial Planning:

- **User Stories / Issues Initially Considered:** 16
- **User Stories / Issues Completed:** 12

## Challenges & Solutions:

### Biggest Challenges:

- **Kevin:** Navigating a severely limited API and the complexity of database integration with views.
- **Esteban:** Managing state and ensuring proper rendering of selected teams and upcoming games.
- **Ty:** Learning React Native and applying it quickly, alongside handling the connection between account creation and the database.
- **Julio:** Working with new technologies, including JavaScript and React, as well as understanding and implementing databases.

### Solutions:
- **Kevin:** Spent hours reading documentation, making mistakes, and using asynchronous storage as a fallback for database issues.
- **Esteban:** Refined state management, filtered API data, and ensured proper UI display for team selection and upcoming games.
- **Ty:** Collaborated with the team to get account creation working with the database.
- **Julio:** Used documentation, tutorials, and experimentation to overcome challenges in learning new tools and technologies.

---

## Project Experience:

### Favorite / Most Interesting Part of the Project:

- **Kevin:** Learning new technologies and pushing through challenges in a short timeframe.
- **Esteban:** Designing the user interface and ensuring smooth functionality for team selection and upcoming game display.
- **Ty:** Working with teammates with diverse experiences and tackling the project prompt.
- **Julio:** Working on the database design and learning new skills through experimentation.

### If You Could Do It Over, What Would You Change?

- **Kevin:** Focus on breaking down tasks into simpler parts and getting the database working earlier.
- **Esteban:** Plan state management and API data filtering earlier to avoid last-minute troubleshooting.
- **Ty:** Improve the connection between the account creation page and the database.
- **Julio:** Ensure early accessibility of the database across all views for smoother development.

### Most Valuable Thing Learned:

- **Kevin:** Resilience and some JavaScript.
- **Esteban:** Working with APIs and managing state in React.
- **Ty:** Using local storage for data management.
- **Julio:** The importance of communication within the team.

## Conclusion:

### Project Success:

- **Kevin:** While it didn't turn out as expected, it was a good learning experience. With the knowledge I have now, I would approach the project differently.
- **Esteban:** Despite challenges, the core features were implemented, and we learned a lot from the experience.
- **Ty:** A great first project, offering valuable experience in agile development and app building.
- **Julio:** The final app isn't perfect, but the project was a success in terms of team collaboration and learning.

### What We Set Out to Do vs. What Got Done:

- **Kevin:** We aimed to create a personalized sports betting app, but had to pivot to a simpler app that allowed users to log in, select favorite teams, and view matchups.
- **Esteban:** The goal of a feature-complete app was scaled back, but we successfully implemented core features like login, team selection, and upcoming games.
- **Ty:** The initial vision was grand, but we created a basic CRUD app due to time constraints.
- **Julio:** We set out to build a sports betting app with odds, but only got partial functionality, such as team tracking without accurate odds.

## Key Takeaways:

### Largest Victory:

- **Kevin:** Successfully filtering API calls to dynamically retrieve games between specific dates.
- **Esteban:** Successfully displaying favorite teams and upcoming games with correct logos.
- **Ty:** Connecting the account creation process with the database.
- **Julio:** Successfully linking favorite teams to the database.

### Final Assessment:

- **Kevin:** The project was stressful, but I learned a lot about JavaScript and web development. I would approach the same project differently with the knowledge I have now.
- **Esteban:** A challenging but rewarding experience, with room for improvement. I learned a lot about APIs, state management, and debugging.
- **Ty:** It was a tough project, but I gained valuable experience and learned a lot.
- **Julio:** Despite not being fully satisfied with the final product, I’m proud of the progress we made and the knowledge we gained.

## Future Directions:

- With more time, we would refine the app’s features, including improving the database integration and adding accurate betting odds for games. We also aim to improve the user interface and experience, while implementing additional features that were originally part of the scope.
